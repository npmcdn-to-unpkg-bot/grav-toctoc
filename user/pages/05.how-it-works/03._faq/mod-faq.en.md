I have always taken a lot of pleasure out of preparing outings for me and my friends, holidays, parties, and I am often called upon for ideas or tips. I also travel a lot and I always find more pleasant to discover a destination accompanied by someone who knows the place and who will help me divert from the touritic paths. 
The idea then naturally came to become a holiday planner in Marseille, as I have lived in the region for many years, I know it well and I love living here. It is a more and more praised destination, with a changing reputation, and people from accross the world curious to visit the city. 
I wanted to show my city in its best possible way and help visitors make the most of their stay and holiday in Marseille with tips from a local. This is how toctocMarseille is born.

</h4>

Thanks to toctocMarseille, visitors will get to discover the city in an authentic way and discover unusual places. They are things to do for every taste, and my goal is to help you enjoy the most your holiday. 
I have lived in the south of France for over 10 years, and I know the region very well. I have hiked in many places, I often go off with the train, boat or car to discover new places. 
I am adventurous and sporty, and I have explored many places by foot, bike, or swimming. I have up until now worked in the cultural sector, event planning, and I know the Marseille artistic and cultural offer well.
Adding to that, planning a holiday abroad takes a lot of time and it is not always easy to find the right information. I provide this service. I also find it a lot more interesting to discover a city through the eyes of one of its inhabitants, which makes your stay unique and more authentic.
