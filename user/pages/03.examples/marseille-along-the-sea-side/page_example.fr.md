As we leave the Old Port, I often go south. From the **Catalans beach**, 14 km of trails are available to us, with a view on the sea. At the end is Marseille's first cove, **Callelongue**. It looks like a dream!

There are many beautiful tours to be done, with stops in little fishing harbors, heavenly swimming areas, and breath-taking views.  

#### Possible stops: 
* Snack break in a bakery
* pizza picnic with your feet in the water
* swimming...
