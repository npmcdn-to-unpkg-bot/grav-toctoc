This is my favorite walk to **discover Marseille's must-sees**. The visit begins in the **Old Port**, and its daily fish market. A few steps away is Marseille's oldest neighborhood "**le Panier**", where the Greeks began the foundation of the city.  

===

I go there to walk in the pedestrian alleys, and especially to eat the famous navettes, and the **best ice-cream in town**. I often prolong the tour to the new **MuCEM museum**, which boasts one of my favorite views of the city and the sea.

#### Possible stops:
* A coffee break in a typical Old Port bistro
* Snack breaks to taste navettes and artisanal ice-cream
* Discovering the p√©tanque musem
* Window-shopping designer boutiques
