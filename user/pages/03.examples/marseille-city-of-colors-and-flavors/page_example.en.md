Marseille is made of **111 neighborhoods**, each one different from the last. At the center of it all, I like to go from one to the other and feel as if I was travelling.  

===

The animated neighnorhood of **Cours Julien** offers many alleys, where art galleries, young designers, and street artists have taken over the urban space.  

A bit lower, in the neighborhood of **Noailles**, the immigration meeting point, one can find communities from Africa and elsewhere reunited. This tour is rich in flavors and colors.

#### Possible stops:

* Oriental pastry tasting
* Soap shop visit
* Local market
* Shopping in designer boutiques
