===

Discover my city with me and live the adventure like a local. On a tour adapted to your taste, we will uniquely explore Marseille. You will have the occasion to discover the locals' culture and lifestyle, local secrets and anecdotes, and visit the best shops.

You will enjoy your vacation without worrying about logistics, or being confronted by the language barrier. I speak English, German, and French.  

The half-day or full day tours are custom-made, according to your tastes. They are aimed at individuals, families, and small groups (no more than 5 people).  

The tours can be done on foot, by bicycle, on public transport, by car... We can also create excursions outside the city.  

**This service costs 150€/half-day. The price does not include transport fees (metro, bus, or taxi), activities, food, or drink.**
